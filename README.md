### Contribution guidelines ###

This project is designed for WAMPServer. Install the latest version from:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/files/latest/download

The gulp file expects the Apache directory to be:
/wamp/www

This should work on either Windows or Linux as long as the directory is the same. The gulpfile watches will automatically copy the files into that directory
if they change. This allows a fluent dev experience.
